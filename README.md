# ConnectSphere

A data analysis project focused on exploring and analyzing advertising data to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/connectsphere.git
   cd connectsphere

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Jupyter notebooks:
```bash
   jupyter notebook
```

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the advertising dataset.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
- `docs/`: Contains the project documentation.
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
- `results/`: Contains the results of the data analysis.

## Data Description

The advertising dataset contains information about the advertising campaign, including the following columns:

- `Daily Time Spent on Site`: The amount of time (in minutes) that users spent on the website.
- `Age`: The age of the user.
- `Area Income`: The income of the user's area.

- `Timestamp`: The timestamp of the ad click.
- `Clicked on Ad`: Whether the user clicked on the ad (1) or not (0).

## Data Analysis

The project performs the following analysis:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and identify patterns and trends.
- Data visualization to better understand the data and identify patterns and trends.
- Machine learning to build a model to predict whether a user will click on the ad or not.

## Results

The results of the data analysis are stored in the `results/` directory.
